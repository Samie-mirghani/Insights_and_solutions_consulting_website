            <p><strong>International travel can transform your life!</strong></p>

            <p>My brother Jim and I were young and in dire need of a new adventure. Raised in a large family in lake-adorned northern Minnesota, we had so many siblings that we rarely went anywhere. Our family station wagon resembled a small military transport vehicle. We would all pile into the front, middle and far-back bench seats with no seatbelts — zip-zero-nada — an arrangement that would trigger heartburn for today’s vehicle safety inspectors.</p>

            <p>We constantly teased and shoved one another down the ranks from oldest to youngest. No doubt, we drove our mother crazy. Every. Single. Day.</p>

            <p>I distinctly remember the one and only family trip to Minneapolis. I recall running up and down the aisles of the train, playing in the bathroom with my older sister, and flushing the toilet to watch it spill out onto the tracks. Imagine that sanitary scene. But I digress. Back to the Stupidity Tour.</p>

            <p>Jim and I flew into Beijing in 1985 emboldened with a dangerous level of curiosity mixed with travel-related stupidity. China was just opening up to westerners. Beijing felt sleepy — few tall buildings, a sprawling mass of humanity, and bicycle riders ruling the road like a swarm of bees, flowing without cussing, collisions, or conflict.</p>

            <p>Our first stop was dinner with a U.S. journalist based in Beijing to gather travel tips, cultural insights, and political context. Still, most lessons were learned the hard way. Few people spoke English and we spoke zero Mandarin, Cantonese, or any other Chinese dialect.</p>

            <p>Thankfully, we met cultural navigators along the way — including Dr. Lu, an older medical doctor who learned English from missionaries, and Mary, a retired teacher who worked with the Flying Tigers during World War II.</p>

            <p>From Beijing we traveled to the Great Wall, then by train to Shanghai — a more modern, open city with a growing private sector. We journeyed through the countryside, past rice paddies, donkey carts, and people in constant motion, before heading south near the Laos border and ending in Hong Kong, then still part of the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>We met kind and curious people — and also puzzled officials who seemed surprised we’d been allowed into the country. At times, their questions were warranted.</p>

            <p>One unforgettable moment occurred on the train from Beijing to Shanghai when a young opera singer stopped mid-aisle, asked who we were, and then entertained the entire train car with classical Chinese opera songs. We shared no common language — yet formed a human connection that has lasted decades.</p>

            <p>Another memory justified the “stupid” in the Stupidity Tour. We followed a money changer down a side street and into a dark alley. Jim emerged moments later with a wad of local currency, and we ran back to the hotel with pounding hearts and a renewed respect for caution.</p>

            <p>Mary later invited us into her simple home for green tea and stories of her childhood, the Flying Tigers, and a changing China. She gifted us a small plastic toy we named <em>Bathboy</em>, who became our unofficial travel advisor — appearing in photos, on trains, rickshaws, and restaurant tables.</p>

            <p>Food became easier once we adopted a new ordering tactic: point at whatever looked good on nearby tables, double-check with Bathboy, and hope for the best. The results were delicious.</p>

            <p>Near the Laos border, I was surprised to understand local dialects tied to Thai — a preview of future work in refugee camps across Southeast Asia. We visited the Stone Forest, ancient temples, and wished for better judgment and good luck.</p>

            <p>We ended in Hong Kong — loud, crowded, electric, and politically poised for change. Jim and Bathboy returned to Washington, D.C. I flew back to Thailand to continue my own informal version of the Peace Corps.</p>

            <p>For both of us, the Stupidity Tour reshaped our lives. Jim built a 30+ year career in Taiwan and Beijing. I pursued international development across Bangladesh, Sudan, Kenya, and beyond.</p>

            <p>We left China inspired by the beauty of the people, fascinated by transformation — and just a little less stupid about international travel.</p>
